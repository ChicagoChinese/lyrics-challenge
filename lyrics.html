  Something you didn’t personally ignite<br>
  
  That can’t be called a flame<br>
  
  Something you didn’t personally touch<br>
  
  That can’t be called a jewel<br>
  
  You ah you<br>
  
  Finally appeared<br>
  
  We only met by chance<br>
  
  This heart was smashed to pieces<br>
  
  The entire world completely fell apart<br>
  
  <br>
  
  Someone who isn’t personally killed by you<br>
  
  Has absolutely no reason to continue living<br>
  
  You ah you<br>
  
  Finally appeared<br>
  
  We only met by chance<br>
  
  This heart was smashed to pieces<br>
  
  The entire world completely fell apart<br>
  
  <br>
  
  If this life must end<br>
  
  Then I must die by your hands<br>
  
  Then I must die by your hands<br>
  
  Then I must die by your hands<br>
